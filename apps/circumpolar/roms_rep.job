# =============================================================================
#  Self resubmitting PBS bash script:
#
#  * Submits a followon job before executing the current job.  The followon 
#    job will be in the "H"eld state until the current job completes
#
#  * Assumes program being run is checkpointing at regular intervals and is
#    able to resume execution from a checkpoint
#
#  * Does not assume the program will complete within the requested time
#
#  * Uses an environment variable (NJOBS) to limit the total number of 
#    resubmissions in the sequence of jobs
#
#  * Allows the early termination of the sequence of jobs - just create/touch
#    the file STOP_SEQUENCE in the jobs working directory.  This may be done 
#    by the executable program when it has completed the "whole" job or by hand 
#    if there is a problem
#
#  * This script may be renamed anything (<15 characters) but if you use the -N 
#    option to qsub you must edit the qsub line below to give the script name 
#    explicitly
#
#  * To use: 
#         - make appropriate changes to the PBS options above and to the 
#           execution and file manipulation lines belo
#         - submit the job with the appropriate value of NJOBS, eg:
#                    qsub -v NJOBS=5 <scriptname>
#
#  * To kill a job sequence, either touch the file STOP_SEQUENCE or qdel
#    the held job followed by the running job
#
#  * To test, try  "sleep 100"  as your executable line
